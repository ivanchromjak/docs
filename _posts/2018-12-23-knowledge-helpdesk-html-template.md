Within the template you'll find the following folders:

## Using Build Process
To setup and compile template source files (LESS/JS) from `/src` folder, run the following npm commands using terminal in template directory: 

- `npm install` (run once to install dependencies)  
- `npm run dev` (compile all sources to `assets` folder)  

Additional commands: 

- `npm run watch` (watch files and compile automatically every time a file changes) 
- `npm run build` (compile all sources and minify)

The template uses jQuery Autocomplete script, details how to modify can be found on the script page:   [​https://www.devbridge.com/sourcery/components/jquery-autocomplete/](​https://www.devbridge.com/sourcery/components/jquery-autocomplete/).
